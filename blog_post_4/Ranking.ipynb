    "Imagine a government building an AI-driven auditing system to find people at 'high risk' of being tax cheats, and then auditing them based on that risk. This is a pretty common use case, in fact a number of government already use ML in this way to do targeted auditing of various kinds.\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach here is to take the historical records of auditing results and use them to build a model that maps data available about the whole cohort to a risk score. There are many interesting and difficult ethical challenges here, but this blog entry wants to focus on one: once we have a risk score, how do we select who to audit?\n",
